# Sails JS Chess Server

Simple Chess server with Sails JS. The idea is to make a simple and easy to implement server with SailsJS that can store and return users, games and states for that games, so 2 players can play chess without the necessity to be online at the same time, and have a history of games played together, and eventually we can make a leaderboard.
